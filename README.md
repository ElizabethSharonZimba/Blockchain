# Blockchain Mining Worker Cluster Deployment

This project aims to develop a system that allows users to deploy a cluster of blockchain mining workers with just one click. Additionally, it provides a web page interface to monitor and report on the statistics of the mining workers.

## Team Members

- Tools: Blockchain technology (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin), Web3.js

## Challenge Statement

**Problem:** Blockchain mining requires significant computational resources, and setting up and managing a cluster of mining workers can be complex and time-consuming.

**Solution:** Develop a system that allows users to deploy a cluster of blockchain mining workers with just one click. Additionally, provide a web page interface to monitor and report on the statistics of the mining workers.

**What it will not solve:** The project will not delve into the development of the blockchain mining algorithm itself but will focus on the deployment and monitoring infrastructure.

**Target Users:** Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, developers, and organizations interested in blockchain mining.

## Risks

**Technical Risks:** Ensuring compatibility and stability across different blockchain platforms, managing the scalability of the deployment infrastructure, and addressing security vulnerabilities.

**Non-Technical Risks:** Legal and regulatory challenges related to cryptocurrency mining, potential for misuse of the deployed resources for malicious activities.

## Infrastructure

- **Version Control:** GitHub flow will be used for branching and merging in the team's repository.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Docker containers will be used for each mining worker, orchestrated and managed using Kubernetes.
- **Data Population:** The mining workers will interact with the blockchain network to mine blocks and generate statistics, which will be collected and displayed on the web page.
- **Testing:** Automated testing frameworks such as Jest for backend testing and Cypress for frontend testing will be used. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will be set up using GitHub Actions.

## Existing Solutions

**Similar Products:** There are existing platforms and services that offer cloud-based cryptocurrency mining solutions, but they often lack transparency and control over the mining process. Our project aims to provide a self-managed solution with full visibility into the mining operation.
